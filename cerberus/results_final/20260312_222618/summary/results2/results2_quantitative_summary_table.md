# Results 2 Quantitative Summary Table

## Section A: Required 100-step production run

| Integrator | Production steps | Mean T [K] | Std T [K] | Max |ΔE/E0| [%] | Mean |ΔE/E0| [%] | Comment |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Velocity-Verlet | 100 | 94.42 | 1.43 | 0.082 | 0.033 | Bounded drift; near target state. |
| Euler | 100 | 185.27 | 74.57 | 127.587 | 39.788 | Strong drift/heating over required run; not a stable NVE trajectory. |

## Section B: RDF structural comparison

| Feature | Present work r/sigma | Present work g(r) | Rahman reference r/sigma | Rahman reference g(r) | Reference provenance | Comment |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| First peak | 1.090 | 2.841 | 1.088 | 2.700 | paper_anchored x (y approx.) | Broadly correct location; present peak height is lower. |
| First minimum | 1.550 | 0.622 | 1.559 | 0.620 | shape_anchor (manual approx.) | Minimum position and depth are broadly consistent. |
| Second peak | 2.090 | 1.253 | 2.059 | 1.250 | paper_anchored x (y approx.) | Second-shell position is consistent; present peak is lower. |
| Tail | >=4.0 (mean) | 1.002 | 3.412 | 1.000 | shape_anchor (manual approx.) | Long-range trend returns toward g(r)=1. |

Notes:
- Required run metrics are derived from manifest-linked `lj_brief` production CSV files (100 steps, 101 frames).
- RDF values are from manifest-linked long Verlet RDF run; Rahman values are manual figure anchors (not tabulated exact data).
